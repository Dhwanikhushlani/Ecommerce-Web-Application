Q17. What is the purpose of the <doctype> declaration in an HTML document?

Ans : The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in an HTML document serves the purpose of informing the web browser about the 
      version of HTML being used. It ensures that the browser renders the webpage correctly by triggering standards
      mode, which follows the official specifications for HTML, rather than quirks mode, which emulates older, less 
      standard-compliant behavior. In HTML5, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration is simple (<!DOCTYPE html>) and does not 
      reference a specific version of HTML, as it applies to the entire HTML5 specification.
