Q16. What is the purpose of the <head> tag in an HTML document?

Ans : <!-- The <head> tag in an HTML document serves the purpose of containing metadata and links to resources that are 
not directly displayed on the webpage. It provides information about the document, such as:

1. Document Title: The <title> tag inside <head> sets the title of the webpage that appears in the browser's
                 title bar or tab.

2. Metadata: The <meta> tags provide information such as character encoding, author of the document, and viewport
          settings for responsive design.

3. Stylesheets and Scripts: The <link> tag is used to include external CSS stylesheets, and the <script> tag can
                             link external JavaScript files or embed JavaScript.

4. SEO Information: Metadata like descriptions and keywords that help with search engine optimization (SEO). -->
